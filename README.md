#  SLR(1) Parser with Streamlit

This is a Streamlit-based interactive web app for building and visualizing an SLR(1) parsing table from a given context-free grammar. It allows users to input grammar rules, and then generates the FIRST, FOLLOW, LR(0) items, and finally the SLR(1) parsing table.

> Designed for compiler design students and enthusiasts to understand parsing concepts with ease through a visual and interactive UI.

---

##  Features

- Input grammar rules in a user-friendly sidebar
- Automatic augmentation of the grammar
- Computes:
  - FIRST sets
  - FOLLOW sets
  - LR(0) item sets
  - GOTO transitions
- Displays the SLR(1) parsing table in a clean tabular format
- Highlights reduction and shift actions
- Error checking and helpful messages for invalid grammar rules

## ðŸ›  Technologies Used

- Python
- Streamlit â€“ for interactive UI
- Pandas â€“ for tabular data display
- Tabulate â€“ for structured formatting (optional usage)

##  How to Use

### 1. Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/vedikagrawal/compiler-design-project.git
cd Compiler_Design_project

### 2. Install dependencies:

pip install streamlit pandas tabulate

### 3. Run the Streamlit app:

streamlit run app.py

> Replace app.py with the filename if itâ€™s different.

## ðŸ“˜ Example Grammar Format

In the sidebar, enter grammar rules like:

E -> E + T | T  
T -> T * F | F  
F -> ( E ) | id

Each rule should use -> and separate alternatives with |. Do not forget to add whitespace between symbols.

##  Behind the Scenes

This parser:

1. Augments the grammar by adding a new start symbol.
2. Generates LR(0) item sets using the Closure and GOTO functions.
3. Computes FIRST and FOLLOW sets using recursive methods.
4. Constructs the SLR(1) parsing table, marking Shift, Reduce, GOTO, and Accept actions.

## ðŸ§ª Example Output

Hereâ€™s a snippet of what youâ€™ll see in the output parsing table:

| State | id | + | * | ( | ) | $ | \| | E | T | F |
|-------|----|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 0     | S5 |   |   | S4 |   |   |   | 1 | 2 | 3 |
| ...   |    |   |   |    |   |   |   |   |   |   |

## ðŸ’¡ Tips

- Non-terminals should be uppercase (e.g., E, T, F)
- Terminals are lowercase or symbols (+, *, id, (, ))
- Use Îµ for epsilon (empty string) if needed
